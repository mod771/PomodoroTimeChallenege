### My Process

## Built With
- HTML (provided by selfteach Advent of JavaScript)
- CSS (provided by selfteach Advent of JavaScript)
- JavaScript

## What I learned
    I learned about setInterval and setTimeout. The alert box with the timer was out would keep popping up before the ring circle would change color so had to put in a setTimeout so it would wait before popping up.

    setTimeout(function() { 
        alert("Time's Up!");
    }
